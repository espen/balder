=== Optional: add photos directly to disk

The gallery has a web-based upload tool using Flash. Alternatively you can upload files directly by doing this:

Put photos in containing folders(albums) in the specified gallery folder.
Hierarchy of folders is not fully supported.

This format is recommended:

./ski weekend in hemsedal/snow.jpg
./ski weekend in hemsedal/afterski.jpg
./trip to iran/beautiful girls in tehran.jpg
./trip to iran/mosque in yazd.jpg
./trip to iran/powder snow in dizin.jpg

Every time you manually add photos to disk you must scan by visiting /photos/scan

In future releases the scan will be automated.
